                        This project is an effort to document the cultural
                        heritage of Sicily from c. 1061 â€“ 1194, a transformative
                        period in the island's history, by using print,
                        photographic, web and geolocation technologies to
                        identify and explicate dilapidated, at-risk, and/or
                        hard-to-access monuments. The island's castles,
                        monasteries, churches, palaces, bridges, and other
                        monuments are housed in a NoSQL database that provides
                        maximum flexibility of data storage as well as when
                        information is queried and returned. The website, which
                        is very much under construction, is being developed with
                        a close eye toward usability that encourages both
                        scholars and students to interact with the interface and
                        learn more about Sicily's Norman past. Each site has its
                        own discrete page embedded with pertinent information,
                        including photos and display location on a regional map.
                        The geolocation information makes it possible to travel
                        to the site and ultimately there will be versions of the
                        interface available to users of both tablets and mobile
                        phones. This is especially valuable as it is difficult
                        to reach many of these sites as they are often not well
                        signed and at significant elevation. In time, there will
                        be an array of visualizations available to help make
                        sense of the data. These will include density charts for
                        monasteries and fortifications as well as pie charts
                        that offer information about Sicily's religious houses
                        (Latin vs. Greek, monastic order, status, etc.). We are
                        grateful for the financial support this project has
                        received from the Angelo and Mary Cali Fund for Italian
                        Studies, an award administered by the Dean of the
                        #[a(href="http://www.montclair.edu/chss/") College of Humanities and Social Sciences],
                        #[a(href="http://www.montclair.edu/") Montclair State University] as well as from the Dean's Office itself.

                      This site would not be possible without the friendship of
                      Bob and Debby Logan. Their love of Sicily, the catalyst
                      for our first visit to the island in 2004, as well as
                      Debby's fluent Italian, intrepid driving, and warm
                      companionship during our many adventures together are the
                      real elements of this virtual experience.
